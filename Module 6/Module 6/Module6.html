    <p>A butterfly is an insect belonging to the order Lepidoptera,
         characterized by its colorful wings and a life cycle that includes four stages:
          egg, larva (caterpillar), pupa (chrysalis), and adult. Butterflies are known for their beauty and are often found in gardens, meadows, and forests.
           They play a crucial role in ecosystems as pollinators, helping to fertilize plants. Additionally, butterflies exhibit a wide range of colors and patterns,
         which can serve purposes such as camouflage, warning predators, or attracting mates.</p>
